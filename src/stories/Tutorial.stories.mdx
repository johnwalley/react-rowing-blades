# Getting started with React Rowing Blades

It's really quite simple. Find the code (three character alphanumeric string) which identifies the club you are want. The easiest way to do this is to search in the <LinkTo kind="Example/Introduction" story="page">Introduction</LinkTo>.

```js
<Blade club="emm" />
```

<div>
  <Blade club="emm" />
</div>
